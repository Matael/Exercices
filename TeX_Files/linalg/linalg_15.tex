Is the family of two vectors a basis of $\mb{R}^2$ ? If yes, is this basis orthonormal ? If it is a basis but not on orthonormal one, proposes an orthonormal basis constructed with this family. For each question, you should justify your answers.
\begin{equation}
	[\bs{\Phi}]=\begin{bmatrix}
		{1/\sqrt{2}} & {1/\sqrt{2}} \\
		{1/\sqrt{2}} & {-1/\sqrt{2}}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

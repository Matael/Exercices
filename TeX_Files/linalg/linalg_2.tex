\solution{
Let $P$ and $Q$ be two polynomials of degree lower than $n$. Hence there exists two sequences $\{p_k\}_{k=0..n}$ and $\{q_k\}_{k=0..n}$ so that
 \begin{equation}
 	P(X)=\dsum{k=0}{n} p_k X^K\esp 
 	Q(X)=\dsum{k=0}{n} q_k X^K.
 \end{equation}
Some of the elements of these sequences can be equal to zero as the degree of these polynomials is not necessarily $n$. The sum $S$ of $P$ and $Q$ is 
\begin{equation}
	S(X)=\dsum{k=0}{n} (p_k+q_k) X^K
\end{equation}
This polynomial is trivially of degree lower than $n$.\\
Let now consider a real numbre $\lambda$, the polynomial $\lambda P$ defined by 
\begin{equation}
	\lambda  P(X)=\dsum{k=0}{n} \lambda p_k X^K
\end{equation} 
is of degree lower than $n$.

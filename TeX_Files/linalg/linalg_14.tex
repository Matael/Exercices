Does the matrix $[\bs{\Phi}]$ contain  two vectors which define a basis of $\mb{R}^2$ ? If yes, is this basis orthonormal? If it is a basis but not an orthonormal one, proposes an orthonormal basis constructed with this family. For each one of these questions, you should justify your answers, at least shortly.
\begin{equation}
	[\bs{\Phi}]=\begin{bmatrix}
		{1/\sqrt{2}} & {1/\sqrt{2}} \\
		{1/\sqrt{2}} & {-1/\sqrt{2}}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

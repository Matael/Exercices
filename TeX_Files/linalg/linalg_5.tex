Is the family of three vectors a basis of $\mb{R}^3$ ? If yes, is this basis orthonormal ?
\begin{equation}
	[\bs{\Phi}]=\begin{bmatrix}
		{1} & {-1} & 0\\
		{-1} & {2} & -1\\
		{0} & {-1} & 2
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\solution{
This family is a basis and this can be justified in several ways
\begin{itemize}
	\item The three vectors are independent:
	Let suppose that we have a combination of the three vectors $\bs{\Phi}_i$ associated to the columns of the matrix so that
	\begin{equation}
		\lambda_1 \bs{\Phi}_1+\lambda_2 \bs{\Phi}_2+\lambda_3 \bs{\Phi}_3=\tb{0}
	\end{equation}
	The first line leads to $\lambda_1=\lambda_2$ and the last one to $\lambda_2=2\lambda_3$. This allows to eliminate $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_3$ in the second equation which reads:

		
\end{itemize}

\it
Let consider the expressions of real and imaginary parts of $z$ 
\be
x=\dfrac{z+\cj{z}}{2}\esp y=\dfrac{z-\cj{z}}{2j}
\ee
The equation of the line then becomes:
\be
\left(
\dfrac{a}{2}+\dfrac{b}{2j}
\right)z+\left(
\dfrac{a}{2}-\dfrac{b}{2j}
\right)\cj{z}+c=0
\ee
or
\be
\cj{\omega} z+\omega\cj{z}+c=0 \esp \omega=\left(
\dfrac{a}{2}+j\dfrac{b}{2}
\right)
\ee
\it
Let $z_0=x_0+jy_0$ be the complex number associated to the center of the circle. If one considers $z'=z-z_0$, the equation of the circle becomes
\be 
z'\cj{z'}=R^2
\ee
Hence the complex equation of the circle is:
\be 
z\cj{z}-z_0\cj{z}-\cj{z_0}z=R^2-\abs{z_0}^2.
\ee
\item Let $z$ be the affix of one element in the inverse of $\mc{L}$. Then $1/z$ is solution of the complex equation of the line:
\be
\dfrac{\cj{\omega}}{z}+\dfrac{\omega}{\cj{z}}+c=0
\ee
This equation becomes
\be
\cj{\omega}\cj{z}+{\omega}{z}+cz\cj{z}=0
\ee
We can identify a form close to a complex equation of a circle:
\be
z\cj{z}-z_0\cj{z}+\cj{z_0}{z}=0 \esp z_0=\dfrac{\cj{\omega}}{c}.
\ee
As the right hand side is null, the radius of the circle is $\abs{z_0}$:
\be
z\cj{z}-z_0\cj{z}+\cj{z_0}{z}=R^2-\abs{z_0}^2 \esp z_0=\dfrac{\cj{\omega}}{c}\esp 
R=\abs{z_0}.

Let $f\in L^2(]-1;1[)$ with its canonical inner product. Let $\mb{P}_n$ be the set of polynomials of degree lower than $n$. We are looking to the best approximation of $f$ by a polynomial $P$ of degree lower than $n$ with the standard norm:
\begin{equation}
\ds{\min}\norm{f(x)-P(x)}^2
=
\ds{\min}\ds{\int_{-1}^1}\abs{f(x)-P(x)}^2\d x
\end{equation}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain why $P$ is the orthogonal projection of $f$ on $\mb{P}_n$ and that it is given by 
\begin{equation}
P=\ds{\sum_{i=0}^n <f,P_i>P_i},
\end{equation}
where $P_i$ is an orthononormal family of $\mb{P}_n$.
\end{itemize}


Let $L_i$ be Legendre polynomials defined by:
\begin{align}
	L_0(x)&=1\\
	L_1(x)&=x\\
	\forall k>0,\,(k+1)L_{k+1}(x)&=(2k+1)xL_k(x)-kL_{k-1}(x)
\end{align}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the degree of $L_i$? Justify your answer. 
	\item Show that all the Legendre polynomials $L_i$ are orthogonal one to the other.
	\item What is their value for $x=1$
	\item Are they of norm equal to one ? Justify. 
	\item What is the modification to be applied to formula (1.5) for the family of Legendre polynomial $L_i$ of degree lower than $n$.
\end{itemize}
Let $f=sin(x)$
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the constant polynomial (degree $0$) which is the best approximation of $f$ on $]-1;1[$?
\item What is the polynomial of degree lower than $1$ which is the best approximation of $f$ on $]-1;1[$?
\item What is the polynomial of degree lower than $2$ which is the best approximation of $f$ on $]-1;1[$?
\end{itemize}

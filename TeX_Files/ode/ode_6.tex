What is the solution of  
\begin{equation}
-f'(x)+f(x)=1+x,
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
	f(0)=2,\, f'(0)=1.
\end{equation}

\solution{
The solution of this equation is the sum of a particular solution which do not satisfy the initial conditions and a general one associated to the homogeneous problem \ie{without forcing}.
The particular solution is sought as a first order polynomial 
\begin{equation}
	f_p(x)=ax+b.
\end{equation}
Hence, the necessary conditions on $a$ and $b$ are:
 \begin{equation}
	-f_p'(x)+f_p(x)=-a+ax+b=1+x.
\end{equation}
By identification 
\begin{equation}
	a=1 \and b=2. 
\end{equation}
Hence 
\begin{equation}
	f_p(x)=x+2
\end{equation}
This function satisfies the initial conditions. We have our solution and there is no need of a general solution of the homogeneous equation !

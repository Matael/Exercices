Let consider the following volumic weak form

\begin{equation}
	\forall \,v\esp  \ds{\int_0^1} u'(x)v'(x) \,\d x 
\end{equation}

$]0;1[$ is divided in two elements: $]0;1/2[$ discretized by linear elements and and $]1/2;1[$ discretized by quadratic elements. What is the global matrix associated to this discretization ?

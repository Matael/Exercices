The normal incidence reflection $R$ and transmission coefficient $T$ of a plane wave at an interface between two media of characteristic impedance $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are given by: 
\begin{equation}
	R=\dfrac{Z_1-Z_2}{Z_1+Z_2}\esp T=\dfrac{2Z_2}{Z_1+Z_2}
\end{equation}

Write a Matlab script which 
\begin{itemize}
\item Ask the user to provide two complex numbers $Z_1$ and $Z_2$
\item Compute $R$ and $T$.
\item Display these two coefficients in the prompt
\item Write them in a text file.
\end{itemize}

We are considering the brownian motion of a particle in a 2D space $(x,y)$ space. The process is as follows. The initial position of the particle is $(x=0,y=0)$. A random angle $\theta\in [0;2\pi[$ is chosen to decide the displacement of the particle. Based on the random choice, the position of the particle is updated with a jump of $\cos(\theta)$ in the $x$ direction and $\sin(\theta)$ in the $y$ direction. Then a new displacement step is proceeded. This iterative procedure is done a number N of times. 
Work to do:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Create a script to plot for a given value of $N$, (e.g. $N=100$) the displacement of the particle. and calculate the distance between the origin and the final position.
\end{itemize}

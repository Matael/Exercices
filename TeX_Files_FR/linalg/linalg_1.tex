The set $\mc{F}$ of functions from $\mb{R}$ into $\mb{R}$ is a real vector space.

\solution{Let consider two such functions $f$ and $g$, it is natural to define the sum of these two functions as the function whose value in $x$ is the sum  $f(x)+g(x)$. The product of function $f$ by a real number $\lambda$ is naturally the function whose value in $x$ is $\lambda f(x)$. Then with these two definitions, it is trivial that $\mc{F}$ is a real vector space. At first sight, it can be thought that $\mc{F}$ is just the limit case of $\mb{R}^n$ when $n$ tends to infinity. It will be shown that it is a bit more subtil.\\
